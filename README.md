# CalcMIPS
A basic calculator for MIPS that can be run in the MARS MIPS simulator.(ALL portuguese)

# What it can calculate

* Basic addition/subtraction/multiplication/division;
* Convertion from decimal to 32bit Binary
* Convertion from decimal to Hexadecimal (0x00000000 format)
* Logarithms base 2 and 10. Can only calculate result for integers parameters and only if result is also an integer. 
* Powers. Accepts real numbers as base but only natural numbers for the exponent.
* Square and Cube roots. The result is an approximation of the true value.
* Sine and Cossine. Due to Taylor Series approximation results are only true for values between -Π/2 and Π/2. 

# Bitmap Display

Unfortunately it is not interactive, the only way to use the calculator is through the console.
